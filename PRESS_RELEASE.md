There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Creating an epic end-user experience out of a currently frustrating moment ##
  > Sonos wiaJS streamlines the process of troubleshooting an end customer's Sonos system communication problems by providing realtime visualization of the system's communication.

## Lightweight, short, and to the point ##
  > Sonos wiaJS provides a faster, more interactive solution for Sonos Customer Care to a very common source of customer contact: unstable wireless communication in the system.  By watching, and interpreting realtime visuals with the end user, they are more engaged in the troubleshooting process, as opposed to being put on hold while the CC agent reviews diagnostics.
  > Sonos wiaJS also improves on a previous Java prototype by requiring minimal dependencies with no installation on the end user's end.  The only requirement for the end user is a relatively modern web browser, we do the rest.

## Summary ##
  > Sonos wiaJS improves time to resolution for one of the most common calls to Sonos Customer Care: wireless communication problems.  Visuals are powered by extremely lightweight JavaScript, with minimal dependencies for fast page loading.  The only requirement is that the end user be using a browser which conforms to the JavaScript ES5 standard.

## Problem ##
  > Sonos wiaJS improves time to resolution for one of the most common calls to Sonos Customer Care: wireless communication problems.  This is a much better experience than the current method of submitting diagnostics, and being put on hold while the agent reviews the diagnostics.

## Solution ##
  > Minimial JavaScript library dependencies (D3.JS for visuals, AngularJS for the front end) allow for extremely minimal setup time once connected to the end user's machine.  Principles of modern responsive design allow for a mobile friendly front end to be rapidly created via recycling of AngularJS components should the need arise.

## Quote from You ##
  > This tool has pushed Sonos' already world class Customer Care one more step above the competition, engaging our end user in new ways while demystifying a major driver of contact volumes.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Navigate to the heroku deployed page, input the IP address of the associated ZP if in SonosNET mode, or any ZP if in wireless mode.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Sonos wiaJS IS AWESOME!  I was having all kinds of audio cutouts while trying to play Spotify in my house in New York City, so I called Sonos Customer Care.  Within 10 minutes of being connected to an agent, my system was running so smoothly I could swear it purrs now!  On top of that, the agent showed me how to use Sonos wiaJS to troubleshoot if the problem returns.  Sonos Customer Care is amazing!
